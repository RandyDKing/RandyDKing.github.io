        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
            I graduated from Noble High School in May 2005. I then joined the Air Force and served six years before seperating and working in the car business for a few years.
            After spending time in the workforce I then decided it was time to return to school and further my education. I enrolled at Oklahoma City Communty College in fall 2016 and graduated with an associates degree in MIS in may 2018.
            I then transferred to the University of Oklahoma where I am currently a Junior persuing a bachelors degree in MIS and plan to graduate in spring 2020.
