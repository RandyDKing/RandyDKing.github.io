        <p>
            After I graduated from High School I made the decision to enlist in the U.S. Air Force where I served six years as a Security Forces member.
            I rose to the rank of Staff Seargent and was ultimately responsible for my own flight of 40 people responsible for all security and law enforcement operations during my shift.
            When my time in the service came to an end I then became the inventory manager for Big Red Sports and Imports, Normnan Mitsubishi, and Norman Yamaha where I was responsible for 
            ensuring all vehicles were ready for sale and accounted for. I am currently a volunteer firefighter as well as full time student.
